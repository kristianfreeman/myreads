```

6. Generate TypeScript types:
```bash
npm run cf-typegen
```

### Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run E2E tests:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

View test coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Building and Deployment

### Production Build

Create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

1. First, run the database migration on your remote database:
```bash
npx wrangler d1 execute myreads-db --file=./db/migrations/0001_initial.sql --remote
```

2. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

3. Set production secrets:
```bash
npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
# Enter a secure random string when prompted
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables are configured in `wrangler.json`:

- `JWT_SECRET`: Secret key for JWT token signing (use `wrangler secret` in production)
- `SESSION_DURATION`: Session duration in milliseconds (default: 24 hours)

## Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

- `users`: User accounts with authentication
- `books`: Cached book information from Open Library
- `user_books`: User's book entries with status, ratings, and reviews
- `tags`: Book tags
- `user_book_tags`: Many-to-many relationship for book tags
- `sessions`: User session management

## API Integration

MyReads uses the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) for book data. No API key is required, but please be respectful of their rate limits.
