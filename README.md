## Getting Started

### Why Fork First?

We recommend forking this repository before deploying to Cloudflare Workers. This approach:
- Preserves the git history and connection to the upstream repository
- Allows you to pull updates and improvements from the main project
- Enables you to contribute back with pull requests
- Maintains proper attribution and licensing

> **Note**: We don't use Cloudflare's Deploy Button because it creates a disconnected copy with no git history, making it difficult to stay synchronized with updates.

### Quick Start

1. **Fork this repository** on GitHub
2. Clone your fork:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/myreads.git
cd myreads
```
3. Follow the setup instructions below

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- A Cloudflare account (free tier works)
- Wrangler CLI (installed automatically with dependencies)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/myreads.git
cd myreads
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a D1 database:
```bash
npx wrangler d1 create myreads-db
```

4. Update `wrangler.json` with your database ID from the output above.

5. Run database migrations:
```bash
npm run db:migrations:apply:local
```

6. Generate TypeScript types:
```bash
npm run cf-typegen
```

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

### Setting the Password

For local development, create a `.dev.vars` file:
```bash
# Copy the example file
cp .dev.vars.example .dev.vars

# Or create manually with test password
echo 'APP_PASSWORD=$2b$10$EbzfqltyN01YU8i05F/fo.in5ZyOXo3FHP6i4AvrakJqYJPqS6d/q' > .dev.vars
```

This sets the password to "password". For production, use a secure password (see deployment section).

### Testing

Run unit tests:
```bash
npm test
```

Run E2E tests:
```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

View test coverage:
```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

## Building and Deployment

### Production Build

Create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

### Deploy to Cloudflare Workers

1. Deploy to Cloudflare Workers (this will automatically run migrations):
```bash
npm run deploy
```

2. Set a secure password:
```bash
# Generate and set password in one command:
node scripts/hash-password.mjs | npx wrangler secret put APP_PASSWORD

# Or manually:
node scripts/hash-password.mjs
# Copy the hash, then:
npx wrangler secret put APP_PASSWORD
# Paste the hash when prompted
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Configured in `wrangler.json`:
- `SESSION_DURATION`: Session duration in milliseconds (default: 24 hours)

### Secrets

Must be set via Cloudflare dashboard or wrangler CLI:
- `APP_PASSWORD`: Bcrypt hash of the application password (required)
- `GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY`: Google Books API key for better book search results (optional)

**Never commit passwords or secrets to `wrangler.json`!**

#### Setting up Google Books API (Optional)

For better book search results, you can use the Google Books API instead of Open Library:

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com)
2. Create a new project or select an existing one
3. Enable the "Books API" from the API Library
4. Create credentials (API Key) for the Books API
5. Set the API key as a secret:
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put GOOGLE_BOOKS_API_KEY
   # Paste your API key when prompted
   ```

The app will automatically use Google Books API when the key is configured, falling back to Open Library if not set or if Google Books fails.

## Database Schema

The application uses the following main tables:

- `books`: Cached book information from Open Library
- `book_entries`: Book entries with status, ratings, and reviews
- `tags`: Book tags
- `book_tags`: Many-to-many relationship for book tags

## API Integration

MyReads uses the [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/developers/api) for book data. No API key is required, but please be respectful of their rate limits.
